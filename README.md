- 👋 Hi, I’m @lmmoreira1 ...

  I am a grad student in physics with focus in astrophysics of neutron stars. My years studying this subject
  have teach me some numerical proceedures to solve differential equations and some complicated integrals which
  must be implemented via computer coding. So I have also some experience with C++ and FORTRAN.

- 👀 I’m interested in ...

  numerical proceedures to solve some physical systems, in particular general relativistic and confined plasmas systems.
  
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

  plasma confinement in toroidal geometry, AKA tokamaks, and its instabilities.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

  computational/mathematical infrastructure to be used by scientists.


- 📫 How to reach me ...
